# web-design
A simulated web page made solely on *HTML* and *CSS*. Javascript may be added later on.

## about
The page was made as to test my knowledge on CSS. Few months prior, I was lagging in developing my CSS skills solely due to indiscipline. This site was made as part of a goal, for finishing CSS in under 2 weeks.

## features
Mostly resembles a page related to programming blogs. Simulates all *navigation slides, comments, code snippets* and more. Jokingly explains a tight debate between the use of styles and CSS files. Has a lot of ***"easter eggs"*** because I was bored.

## faults
Page is generally only *CSS* & *HTML*. Any interaction, besides the links, are non-existant. Does not have the power of Javascript
